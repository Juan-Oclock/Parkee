# Directions to Car Map - User Location Tracking Fix

## Test Instructions

### What was Fixed
The "Directions to Car" map modal was not updating the user's location in real-time. The map would show the user's location from when the modal was first opened, but wouldn't track movement as the user walked or drove.

### How it was Fixed
1. **Added real-time location tracking**: The `DirectionsMapView` now has its own location manager that continuously updates the user's position
2. **Dynamic user location marker**: The blue user location dot now moves as the user moves
3. **Smart route recalculation**: The route automatically recalculates if the user moves more than 50 meters from their last position
4. **Proper cleanup**: Location updates stop when the modal is dismissed to save battery

### Testing Steps

1. **Start a Parking Session**
   - Open the Parkee app
   - Tap "Park My Car" to save your current location
   - Verify the location is saved

2. **Open Directions Modal**
   - Tap "Directions to Car" button
   - The modal should appear with the map

3. **Verify Initial State**
   - Check that your current location (blue dot) is displayed
   - Check that the parked car location (green marker) is displayed
   - A route should be drawn between the two points

4. **Test Real-Time Updates**
   - While keeping the modal open, move to a different location (walk or simulate location change in simulator)
   - The blue user location dot should move to follow your new position
   - The route should automatically recalculate if you move more than 50 meters

5. **Test Map Style Changes**
   - While the modal is open, try changing the map style (if available)
   - The user location should continue updating regardless of map style

6. **Test Modal Dismissal**
   - Close the modal
   - Reopen it from a different location
   - The user location should show your current position, not the old one

### Expected Behavior
- ✅ User location updates in real-time on the map
- ✅ Blue location dot follows user movement
- ✅ Route recalculates when user moves significantly (>50m)
- ✅ Location tracking stops when modal is dismissed
- ✅ Map style changes don't affect location tracking

### Technical Changes
- Modified `DirectionsMapView` to use a dynamic `currentUserLocation` state
- Added `DirectionsViewModel` as a `CLLocationManagerDelegate`
- Implemented `startLocationUpdates()` and `stopLocationUpdates()` methods
- Added `onReceive` listener for location updates
- Added smart route recalculation with 50-meter threshold

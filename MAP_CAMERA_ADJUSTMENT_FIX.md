# Map Camera Adjustment Fix

## Problem Statement
When showing the parking details or directions modals, the app was moving only the annotation bubble upward using an offset. This caused the bubble to point to the wrong location on the map since the bubble moved but the underlying map didn't.

## Visual Issue
- **Before Fix**: Bubble moves up → Points to wrong spot on map
- **After Fix**: Entire map shifts up → Bubble still points to correct location

## Solution Implemented

### ContentView Changes

1. **Replaced annotation offset with camera adjustment**
   - Removed: `annotationOffset` that moved only the bubble
   - Added: `mapCameraOffset` that shifts the entire map view
   - Removed the `.offset(y:)` and `.animation()` modifiers from the annotation

2. **New camera update method**
   ```swift
   private func updateCameraForSavedLocation(location: ParkingLocation, offset: CGFloat)
   ```
   - Calculates adjusted map center by adding latitude offset
   - Negative offset moves map upward (annotation appears higher on screen)
   - Preserves the zoom level while shifting the view

3. **Modal state handlers**
   - When parking details sheet shows: Shifts map up by -0.002 latitude
   - When directions modal shows: Same shift
   - When modals dismiss: Resets to original position

### ParkingDetailsView Changes

1. **Proper camera adjustment on modal events**
   - Added `onChange` handler for `showDirectionsModal`
   - Calls `adjustCameraForModal()` when showing
   - Calls `resetCameraPosition()` when hiding

2. **Existing helper methods utilized**
   - `adjustCameraForModal()`: Shifts map center down by -0.0012 latitude
   - `resetCameraPosition()`: Returns to original saved location

## Technical Details

### How Camera Adjustment Works
```swift
// Calculate new center with offset
let adjustedCenter = CLLocationCoordinate2D(
    latitude: location.coordinate.latitude + offset,
    longitude: location.coordinate.longitude
)

// Update camera with animation
cameraPosition = .region(
    MKCoordinateRegion(
        center: adjustedCenter,
        span: MKCoordinateSpan(latitudeDelta: 0.005, longitudeDelta: 0.005)
    )
)
```

### Offset Values
- **ContentView**: -0.002 latitude offset (larger shift for bottom sheets)
- **ParkingDetailsView**: -0.0012 latitude offset (smaller shift for modal context)
- These values ensure the parking location remains visible above modals

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Location Pointing**: Bubble always points to the correct spot on the map
2. **Smooth Animations**: Map shifts smoothly when modals appear/disappear
3. **Better UX**: Users can still see their parking location clearly when interacting with modals
4. **Consistent Behavior**: Same approach works for all modal types

## Testing Instructions

1. **Park a car and open details**
   - Tap "Park My Car"
   - Tap "View Parking Details" 
   - **Expected**: Map shifts up, bubble still points to correct location

2. **Open directions modal**
   - From main screen, tap "Directions to Car"
   - **Expected**: Map shifts up, bubble remains accurate

3. **Close modals**
   - Dismiss any open modal
   - **Expected**: Map smoothly returns to original position

4. **Verify accuracy**
   - Compare bubble position with actual coordinates
   - Check that bubble arrow points to exact parking spot
   - Verify no misalignment after modal interactions

## Future Considerations
- Dynamic offset calculation based on modal height
- Different offsets for different device sizes
- Consideration for landscape orientation
- Smart centering based on available screen space
